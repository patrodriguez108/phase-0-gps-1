Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think that I have a fair understanding of Git and how it works. Something that I did not know how to do was to delete local branches, which Matt and I both found out how to do via Google.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

As mentioned above, deleting local branches. In addition fetching was clarified; before the GPS I had not fetched, and I had no idea what it was before Regina explained that it was like a pull, except unlike pulling it does not automatically merge the branch (at least I hope I'm explaining that right...)

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my pair about commands that I did not know at the top of my head. It was very useful to have him verbally express them to me as I was driving.

I tried not to directly ask the guide anything because I was not sure if I was allowed to. But what was helpful was that Regina stepped in when she felt it right to step in, and she explained when both Matt and I were confused.

* What still confuses you about Git?

I still don't quite have a full grasp on fetching. So once I fetch a remote branch, I then need to merge with my local branch? Is that right?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I believe that my first pairing in a GPS went very smoothly. Aside from technical difficulties like not being able to see Matt's screen once he started sharing, and at times his audio going down that is. I found that Matt and I had some solid communication going down, and Regina was very, very helpful!
