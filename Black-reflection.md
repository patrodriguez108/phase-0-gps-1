## GPS 1.1 Reflection

*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I think I understand the general concepts of why/how we use Git. I'm still struggling with fluency: I still need to look up a lot of the commands, and I occasionally have to take a quick minute just to wrap my head around which part of the process I'm in so I can see the bigger picture.


*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

The fetch/merge process was brand new to me. We took a few minutes to look it up on Google, and our guide (Regina) really helped us to understand the difference between fetch/merge and pull. "Pull" runs fetch/merge as a single process, and using "fetch and merge" lets you grab a repo from Github without automatically merging it.
    

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

WHAT IS FETCH!? Other than that, it was mostly asking questions to communicate what commands to use. "Staying on the same page" questions, essentially.


*What still confuses you about Git?*

I think I have a solid understand about what Git does. I don't really feel confused by anything anymore, but I'm definitely not 100% comfortable and fluent with it. I reckon that'll come from using it constantly.


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

Great! I liked it a lot. I think I learn more effectively when I'm working through stuff with someone else. Vocalizing the steps to solve a problem almost feels like teaching something I've just learned--it makes it stick in my brain.
